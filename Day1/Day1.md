###           5)console.clear():-used to clear the console.
## Question2. Write the differences between var, let and const with example.
### Answer:- These are the keywords where we can define the scope of a particular variable.  
### var:- By using var keyword the scope of the variable is limited to the block it is defined in. 
###    example:- var name = "farhan";
###          var age = "20";
###          var contry = "India";
###          console.log(name);
###          console.log(age);
###          console.log(country);
###             or
###          var a = {(name:"farhan",age:"20",country:"India")};
###          console.log(a) 
###    Let and const:- By using let and const keyword, the scope of the variale is defined within the block of defined by curly braces. {}
###   ex:- {
###         let name = "farhan";
###         let age = "20";
###           name = "sid";
###         console.log{(name,age)};
###        }
###   In let the varibale value can be changed. Here it will print sid as name
     
###     const 
###     ex:-{
###            const name = "farhan";
###            name = "sid";
###            console.log(name);
###          }
###    In const the variable value can't be changed once defined. Here the valur of name will be printed as 'farhan' annd not 'sid'.
